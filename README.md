## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed on your computer
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- A text editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git installed (for version control)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskmaster-pro.git
   cd taskmaster-pro
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   python run.py --init-db
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## 🎓 Key Concepts Explained

### What is Full-Stack Development?
Full-stack development means working on both the **frontend** (what users see) and **backend** (server logic and database). This project teaches you how these parts work together.

### Why Python for Web Development?
- **Beginner-friendly**: Clean, readable syntax
- **Powerful frameworks**: Flask and Django make web development easier
- **Great community**: Lots of tutorials and help available
- **Versatile**: Used by companies like Instagram, Spotify, and Netflix

### Database Fundamentals
You'll learn how applications store and retrieve data persistently, which is essential for any real-world application.

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Module not found" errors
- Make sure your virtual environment is activated
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip list`

### Database errors
- Ensure the database is initialized: `python run.py --init-db`
- Check file permissions in your project directory

### Port already in use
- Kill the process: `pkill -f flask` (macOS/Linux) or check Task Manager (Windows)
- Use a different port: `python run.py --port 5001`

## 🌟 Next Steps

Once you complete this project, consider these next challenges:
- Add email notifications for due tasks
- Implement task sharing between users
- Create a mobile app version
- Add data visualization with charts
- Integrate with external APIs (weather, calendar)
